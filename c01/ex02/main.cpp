/*
    char* 'ptr = &s' is not the same as 'char* ptr = s.c_str()'.

The expression &s takes the address of the string object itself,
which is not the same as the memory address of the character array held by the string.
In fact, taking the address of a string object is not allowed in C++, and will
result in a compilation error.

On the other hand, the c_str() member function returns a pointer to the underlying character
array of the string. This is the memory address of the actual string data.

std::cout << "1- Memory address of the string variable: " << (void *)&brain << std::endl;
std::cout << "2- Memory address of the string variable: " << (void *)brain.c_str() << std::endl;

1- Memory address of the string variable: 0x7ffee2fed780
2- Memory address of the string variable: 0x7ffee2fed781


std::cout << "1- Memory address held by stringREF: " << (void *)&brainRef << std::endl;
std::cout << "2- Memory address held by stringREF: " << (void *)brainRef.c_str() << std::endl;
1- Memory address held by stringREF: 0x7ffee2fed780
2- Memory address held by stringREF: 0x7ffee2fed781
