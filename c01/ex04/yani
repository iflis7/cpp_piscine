Yani was a curious little girl who lived in a small village on the edge of a forest. She had a bright red hat that her mother had made for her, and she loved to wear it everywhere she went.

One day, Yani decided to explore the forest. She had heard many stories about the forest and was eager to see what was hidden inside. So, she put on her red hat and set off into the trees.

As she walked deeper into the forest, Yani saw all sorts of animals - rabbits, birds, squirrels, and more. She was having a great time exploring, when suddenly she heard a loud growl.

Yani turned around and saw a big, fierce bear standing in front of her. She was very afraid, but she didn't want to show it. So, she stood up tall and said, "Who are you and what do you want?"

The bear chuckled and said, "I'm just a hungry bear looking for something to eat. And you, little girl, look like a tasty snack."

Yani knew she had to think fast. She remembered a trick her mother had told her - if you ever meet a bear, hold out your arms and make yourself look bigger. So, Yani held out her arms and shouted, "I'm not afraid of you, Mr. Bear! I'm big and strong, and I won't let you hurt me!"

The bear was surprised by Yani's bravery. He had never met a little girl like her before. So, he decided to let her go and went back into the forest to find something else to eat.

Yani was very relieved and ran back to the village as fast as she could. When she got home, she told her mother all about her adventure in the forest. Her mother was very proud of her and gave her a big hug.

From that day on, Yani was known as the bravest little girl in the village. And whenever she went on an adventure, she always wore her red hat to keep her safe.
